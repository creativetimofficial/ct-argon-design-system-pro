Start your development with a **Premium Argon Design System for Bootstrap 4**. It combines colors that are easy on the eye, spacious cards, beautiful typography, and graphics.

**Fully Coded Components**

**Argon Design System PRO** is built with over 1100 individual components, 43 sections and 17 example pages giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, that you can easily modify using SASS files.<br/>
You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code because all elements are implemented. This Design System is coming with prebuilt examples, so the development process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done. Every element has multiple states for colors, styles, hover, focus, that you can easily access and use. You can view all components [here](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-pro/index.html#basic-elements).

**Core re-built from scratch**

Start your development with a Premium Argon Design System for Bootstrap 4. Argon is a completly new product built on our newest re-built from scratch framework structure that is meant to make our products more intuitive, more adaptive and, needless to say, so much easier to customize. Let Argon amaze you with its cool features and build tools and get your project to a whole new level. It combines colors that are easy on the eye, spacious cards, beautiful typography, and graphics.

**Complex Documentation**

Each element is well presented in a very complex documentation. You can read more about the idea behind this design system [here](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-pro/docs/1.0/getting-started/overview.html). You can check the components [here](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-pro/docs/1.0/components/alerts.html) and the foundation [here](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-pro/docs/1.0/foundation/colors.html).

**Example Pages**

If you want to get inspiration or just show something directly to your clients, you can jump start your development with our pre-built [example pages](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-pro/examples/about-us.html). You will be able to quickly set up the basic structure for your web project.

## Bootstrap 4 Support

**Argon Design System PRO** is built on top of the much awaited Bootstrap 4. This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4 project; you can just import the Argon Design System PRO style over it. Most of the elements have been redesigned; but if you are using an element we have not touched, it will fall back to the Bootstrap default.

## Quick start

- Buy from [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-design-system-pro)

We've also included an optional Gulp file to help you get started with theme customization. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js.

1.  Download the project's zip
2.  Make sure you have node.js (<https://nodejs.org/en/>) installed
3.  Type `npm install` in terminal/console in the source folder where `package.json` is located
4.  You will find all the branding colors inside `assets/scss/argon-design-system-pro/_variables.scss`. You can change them with a `HEX` value or with other predefined variables.
5.  Run in terminal `gulp compile-scss` for a single compilation or `gulp watch` for continous compilation of the changes that you make in `*.scss` files. This command should be run in the same folder where `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` are located
6.  Run in terminal `gulp open-app` for opening the Dashboard Page (default) of the product.
